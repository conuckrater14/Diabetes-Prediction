# Advanced Ensemble Learning for Diabetes Prediction

A high-performance machine learning system for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). This project implements a **Hybrid Ensemble Stacking Architecture** (CNN-LSTM + CatBoost + Random Forest) that achieves **87.01% accuracy**, significantly outperforming standard benchmarks.
